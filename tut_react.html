			<h1>React Introduction</h1>
			<p> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces12345. It was developed at Facebook and released in 20131.
			React is not a framework, but it can be used with other libraries to render to certain environments, such as React 
			Native for mobile applications3. React promotes the development of 
			reusable UI components that display dynamic data2. Its primary goal is to minimize bugs when building UIs 
			by dividing the UI into a React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is
			all about on our homepage or in the tutorial.
			React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little 
			or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity 
			to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.
			If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz.

If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open
 it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime
 code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos
