			<h1>Javascript</h1>
			<p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. 
			It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.
JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as
 Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard 
 library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core
 set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.
JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications. </p>

<h1>JavaScript Statements</h1>
<p>The programming instructions written in a program in a programming language are known as statements. The order of execution of Statements is the same as they are written.

1. Semicolons:

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
A semicolon marks the end of a statement in javascript.
